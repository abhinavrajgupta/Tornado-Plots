# Tornado-Plots
This repository calculates silicon module offsets and visualizes them using tornado plots, which highlight the shift of individual holes within a module. These plots provide critical insights for precise wirebonding, helping prevent wire setting offsets. Upload your data, generate plots, and optimize the wirebonding process.
